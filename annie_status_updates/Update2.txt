Status Update 2

1) This Week:
For this week, I continued researching about structure for motion especially with the
output from COLMAP simulation. I was able to take around 100 pictures of a box and tried
to simulate it to see if it works on COLMAP. It was able to work and I was able to get the
data with the different coordinates of the camera position. I also took a deeper
understand of quaternions which are the coordinates that were outputted. Then, this outputted
file is then feed into a script that Anthony has which makes the data easier to read. I am
currently digging into how the script works to run COLMAP from command line so we can just
collect the data from command line. In addition, I also wrote the documentary on structure
for motion but is not ready to commit yet.


2) Next Week:
For next week, I planned finish the script that runs COLMAP from command and write some
specific instructions on how to run it. In addition, I plan to do more data collection
and see which kind of images outputs the best usable data points.


3) Blockers:
There are currently no technical blockers.
