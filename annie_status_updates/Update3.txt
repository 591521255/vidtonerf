Project: NeRF or Nothing
Status Update 3

1) This Week:
I was able to have some major contribution this week. I was able to build the extrinsic
and intrinsic matrix from COLMAP data that contains quaternions and the translation vector.
There is one intrinsic matrix that is built from output file cameras.txt and an extrinsic
image for each images in the output file iamges.txt. In addition, I wrote the readme page
for COLMAP that contains a brief description about COLMAP and how the project will be
implementing it. It also contains some information about the data processing output and
some good data collection tips. Lastly, I opened an issue about the execution time of
COLMAP since it takes pretty long to run on my computer and can be a major concern to the
overall project. This week, I learned more about git such as branching, fetching, merging,
and opening pull request. I branch out after I want to work on something and delete the
branch after it has been successfully reviewed and merged.


2) Next Week:
Next week, I plan to work on the whole COLMAP integration by using a script to run COLMAP
from command line which is something that Anthony has worked on. Then, the output file will
be generated from there and using the script I wrote this week, extract the data and get
the respective matrix needed. In addition, I plan to look into rabbitmq which acts like an
queue service that wait for jobs to perform the above procedure.


3) Blockers:
There are currently no technical blockers.
